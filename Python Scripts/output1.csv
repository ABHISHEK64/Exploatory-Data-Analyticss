Summary:
BabyChakras Natural Baby Sunscreen is built with Non-Nano Formulation, which means the particles dont get absorbed into your little ones skin but sit comfortably on top of it while protecting their delicate skin from sun damage by extreme sun rays, UVA & UVB. This non-sticky, moisturizing sunscreen is built with SPF 30+ & PA +++ Technology that makes it not only safe but also highly effective for your kids skin!

Chemical vs Mineral-Based Sunscreens - Which One Is Better?
Chemical Sunscreens contain avobenzone and oxybenzone which can be quite irritating and damaging to sensitive skin. Mineral Based Sunscreens on the other hand are not only great for your childs skin but also great for the ocean! One of its main components is Zinc Oxide which soothes & moisturizes irritated, chapped & sensitive skin while effectively protecting the skin from UVA & UVB rays. Another main component is Titanium Dioxide which coupled with Zinc Oxide provides a broad spectrum coverage from sun damage.
The Non-Nano Formulation ensures that none of the particles are getting absorbed into the bloodstream. This makes the Non-Nano Zinc Oxide Mineral Sunscreen the best choice for your kid!
